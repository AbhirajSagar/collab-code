## Questions
* Is it supposed to be an editor to load up local files in?
  OR
* Is it supposed to be a cloud-based solution allowing you to save files and load it on any system after auth ?
  
## Basic Idea 
* Collaborative cloud-based coding platform
* Enables multiple users to code in real-time
* Includes syntax highlighting for various languages
* Users can login, create account and join rooms
* Persistent sessions for continued access
*  Room specific live chat
*  file and project management system allows users to load and edit files
*  for security and isolation, remote code execution will inside containerized environments

## ðŸš€ #1 Planned Features

* Realtime multi-user editing
* Syntax highlighting
* User sessions and room sharing
* Chat system for collaboration
* File/project management

## ðŸ“¦ Setup (Coming Soon)

Instructions for local development setup will be added once the tech stack is finalized.
